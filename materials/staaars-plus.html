      <h2><b>Background</b></h2>
      <p>The STAAARS+ Fellows program, a part of the <a href = "https://www.canr.msu.edu/prci/">USAID Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Food Security Policy Research, Capacity, and Influence (PRCI)</a>, is a collaboration between Cornell University, Michigan State University (MSU), and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) to advance rigorous, policy-oriented food security research on topics of inclusive agricultural- and rural transformation, development of healthy food systems, and enhanced resilience at individual, household, national and regional levels in Africa and Asia. The objective is to build and reinforce an effective policy research culture within African and Asian policy research organizations that can help build and sustain research capacity beyond the life of PRCI and the STAAARS+ program.</p>
      <p>STAAARS+ teams are selected through a competitive process and paired with <a href = "../staars/mentors/STAARS Bios_2022.pdf">mentors at Cornell</a>, IFPRI or MSU, with whom they will jointly author a paper on a topic of mutual interest that fits within PRCI's broad research priorities. STAAARS+ will support the development of research findings publishable in high quality, peer-reviewed journals; facilitate access to policy outreach networks and policy engagement materials; provide professional development training; build Fellows' international research networks; and support teams’ participation in scientific and policy conferences. The first cohort of STAAARS+ teams was selected in 2020 and a second cohort began in 2021. This RFP marks the beginning of selection for the third cohort of teams.</p>

      <h2><b>Scope of Research and Geographic Focus</b></h2>

      <p>Prospective STAAARS+ teams are invited to develop proposals in the following thematic areas. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Inclusive agricultural and rural transformation to raise rural household incomes (including small farmers), and to create more decent jobs particularly for young women and men;</li>
        <li>Development of healthy food systems, including regulatory issues and private sector engagement, in ways that address food safety and the triple burden of malnutrition; and</li>
        <li>Enhanced resilience at individual, household, national and regional levels (to climate, conflict, and other sources of shocks) to achieve economic and environmental sustainability.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>STAAARS+ teams’ rigorous policy analysis should use existing, high quality data, such as the <a href = "http://surveys.worldbank.org/lsms/programs/integrated-surveys-agriculture-ISA">Living Standards Measurement Study - Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA), Demographic and Health Surveys</a>, or similar datasets. High quality data sets collected locally, by an applicant’s institution or other research organizations in Africa or Asia, can be proposed and will be considered based on a case-by-case assessment of data quality. Mixed methods research projects are welcome. No funding is available for new data collection nor software purchase. Teams are welcome to approach researchers within the <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/prci/">USAID Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Food Security Policy Research, Capacity, and Influence (PRCI)</a> network for guidance on the suitability of a topic and research design for STAAARS+ support.</p>

      <h2><b>Program Structure</b></h2>
      <p>The STAAARS+ program spans 18 months from the release of the RFP to the delivery of final outputs by the STAAARS+ teams. Selected STAAARS+ teams are matched with one (or two) faculty or senior research staff mentor(s) who share an interest in the proposed topic and is willing to be available extensively for consultation and collaboration throughout the duration of the fellowship period. Mentorship and collaboration begin immediately with a series of launch workshops involving the fellows, mentors and STAAARS+ leadership occurring during the first six weeks of the fellowship period.  A period of regular remote collaboration follows, with weekly or biweekly virtual meetings. During this period, training workshops are held at relevant points in the teams’ research process. Training workshops are designed to assist in fellows’ professional development and supplement their technical skills. Topics may include but are not limited to: coding and data management skills; reproducible research processes; technical writing; presentation skills; time management; grant writing; navigating peer review; research ethics; and policy engagement planning. Approximately 9 months from the release of the RFP, the STAAARS+ teams spend three to four weeks visiting a US-based host institution (Cornell, MSU or IFPRI) at which the STAAARS+ team works intensively on the research project while participating in network-building and capacity development activities customized to their self-identified specific needs as a team. STAAARS+ teams will also engage with the broader community through presentations of their work, either in-person (travel restrictions pending) or virtually, at the annual ReNAPRI policy conference or other events organized by PRCI.</p>
      
      
      <h2><b>Eligibility</b></h2>
      <p>This call is open for teams of two to three early career African or Asian researchers currently working for eligible policy research institutions based in sub-Saharan Africa or Asia. Team members must be actively engaged in research, as manifest in published work within the past four years, and hold an M.S. or Ph.D., or equivalent degree – with a strong preference for teams containing multiple Ph.D.-holders – in agricultural economics, economics, geography, sociology, statistics, or a related field. Team members with PhDs should have completed their PhD no more than five years prior to the application deadline, although in exceptional cases a team of three could include one member whose PhD was awarded no more than ten years prior.  Priority is given to proposals from PRCI-affiliated institutions, but teams from other research institutions based in sub-Saharan Africa or low- and middle-income countries of South Asia and Southeast Asia will be considered. Teams from government-affiliated universities or research institutions in Myanmar or Cambodia are ineligible, per USAID restrictions. Qualified female researchers are particularly encouraged to apply and topics with an explicit gender dimension are of particular interest. For guidance, we recommend reviewing <a href ="https://www.canr.msu.edu/prci/Capacity-Strengthening/Technical-Training/Core-Center-Training/Module%201%20Integrating%20gender%20in%20policy%20research%20and%20outreach">training materials on integrating gender into policy research and outreach.</a></p>
      <p>Successful applicants’ sending institutions are required to support STAAARS+ team members in their STAAARS+ work. Sending institutions must provide all STAAARS+ team members with adequate funded time to carry out their research during the remote program periods as well as during travel periods to conferences, workshops, and the mentor’s institution in the United States (US). </p>

Sending institutions must provide all STAAARS+ team members with adequate funded time to carry out their research during the remote program periods as well as during travel periods to conferences, workshops, and the mentor’s institution in the United States (US).</p>
      <p>All travel is contingent on safety with respect to public health risks at the time of travel. Team members must be fully released from other obligations for travel during a three-to-four-week intensive collaboration visit to Cornell, IFPRI, or MSU (depending on their mentor’s institution). Teams will also participate in a roughly weeklong policy conference hosted by <a href ="http://www.renapri.org/">ReNAPRI</a> during or shortly after the fellowship period. In 2022, the annual conference will be hosted by the Agricultural Trade Policy Institute at the Namibia University of Science and Technology. STAAARS+ through PRCI will provide financial support to cover travel expenses for two team members to attend the three-to-four-week visit to Cornell, IFPRI or MSU. Covered expenses will include visa application, airfare, per diems and accommodation at the U.S. institution, as well as to the one-week ReNAPRI policy conference. Teams’ institutions must facilitate the visa application and any other local actions that need to be taken to make the travel possible. Teams will be required to submit a letter of support from their institution as part of their application.</p>
