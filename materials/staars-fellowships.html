    <h2><b>Background</b></h2>
    <p>The Structural Transformation of African Agriculture and Rural Spaces (STAARS) fellowship program,
      a multi-institution collaboration managed by Cornell University in collaboration with the World Bank’s
      Development Research Group, and the Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP), announces its annual
      call for research proposals. Early-career researchers selected as STAARS Fellows in 2024 advance
      rigorous, policy-oriented research on the causal determinants of productivity and income growth, asset
      accumulation, rural employment and risk management in African agriculture and rural spaces.</p>


    <p>The Fellowship covers travel and training expenses. STAARS Fellows will be paired with faculty,
      senior research staff, or affiliated researcher mentors from Cornell University, the World Bank, or PEP,
      with whom they will jointly author a paper on a topic of mutual interest relating to structural
      transformation in Africa south of the Sahara. The program aims for publication of resulting research findings in
      high quality, peer-reviewed
      journals and as working papers. In addition, the World Bank, PEP, and Cornell will facilitate Fellows’
      participation in scientific and policy conferences, provide professional development training, and build
      Fellows international research networks.</p>


    <p>The STAARS Fellowship began in 2016 and to date has supported 70 Fellows from diverse backgrounds. Learn about
      past Fellows <a href="http://barrett.dyson.cornell.edu/staars/fellows/index.html">here</a>.
    </p>


    <h2><b>Scope of Research and Geographic Focus</b></h2>
    <p>Prospective STAARS Fellows are invited to develop proposals in the following thematic areas for empirical work on
      Africa south of the Sahara:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Dynamics of agricultural inputs use, technological change, and productivity growth.</li>
      <li>Rural factor (e.g., credit, labor, land) and product market performance and links to urban markets.</li>
      <li>Agri-food systems and value chains, their performance and evolution.</li>
      <li>Food security, nutrition, health and education linkages.</li>
      <li>Poverty dynamics, risk management and resilience against shocks.</li>
      <li>Sustainable natural resources management.</li>
      <li>Gender and marginalized groups.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>STAARS Fellows’ rigorous policy analysis should use existing data, such as the Living Standards Measurement Study
      – Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS–ISA), Demographic and Health Surveys or similar high-quality datasets
      from Africa south of the Sahara. STAARS does not fund new data collection.</p>

    <h2><b>Eligibility</b></h2>
    <p>The call is open to early career researchers, either Ph.D. students in their final year prior to degree
      completion or preferably those who completed their Ph.D. no earlier than 2018. Priority is given to
      researchers who have earned at least one degree from an African university, plan to work professionally
      in low- and lower-middle income countries, and have proposals relating to the research themes indicated
      above. Qualified female researchers are particularly encouraged to apply. STAARS
      welcomes applications from fresh Ph.D. graduates who can benefit from mentorship and additional training to become
      internationally respected and recognized researchers. Fellows are expected to complete the proposed project by
      submitting findings as a draft working paper by December 13, 2024, and proceeding to submit the paper to a
      peer-reviewed journal and/or conferences by June 30, 2025.</p>
    <p>Researchers are expected to be familiar with and have demonstrated access to existing data sets and have a strong
      working knowledge of appropriate software, typically Stata and/or R, and an interest in econometric analysis of
      high-quality data sets. Knowledge of geo-referenced data and GIS software to
      manage them is an asset.Knowledge of Stata and/or R will be assessed at the finalist stage.</p>

    <h2><b>Funding</b></h2>
    <p>The selected applicants will receive funds to cover travel and participation in a three-week mentorship program
      at Cornell University or the World Bank (based on mentorship). The remainder of the research coordination and
      professional development training will be conducted virtually. Fellows are expected to commit significant time to
      the proposed research and capacity development activities. A modest honorarium will be provided to each Fellow. No
      salary support is available; STAARS will not cover the scholar’s time allocated to this research. A letter of
      support from the candidate’s current advisor/supervisor/or manager is required, explicitly indicating that
      adequate work time will be made available for full participation in the program, if selected. The program cannot
      support costs for any new data collection.</p>

    <h2><b>Program Overview</b></h2>
    <p>The STAARS program spans 15 months from the date of expected selection to the delivery of final outputs by the
      STAARS fellow. Selected STAARS fellows are matched with at least one main mentor
      who is faculty, senior research staff, or an affiliate researcher at Cornell, the World Bank, or PEP and
      who shares an interest in the proposed topic, as well as with a (more junior) peer mentor. Upon selection,
      mentorship and collaboration begin immediately with a series of launch
      workshops involving the fellows, mentors and STAARS leadership occurring during the first several weeks of the
      fellowship period. A period of regular remote collaboration follows, with weekly or biweekly virtual meetings.
      During this period, training workshops are held at relevant points in the teams’ research process. Training
      workshops are designed to assist in fellows’ professional development and supplement their skills. Topics may
      include but are not limited to: coding and data management skills; reproducible research processes; technical
      writing; presentation skills; time management; grant writing; navigating peer review; research ethics; and policy
      engagement planning. In September 2024, the STAARS fellows spend 3-weeks visiting their mentors at the mentor’s
      institution, during which the STAARS fellows work intensively on the research project, participate in feedback
      workshops, hold a public seminar, and participate in network-building activities.</p>

        <h2>Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          The call is open for early career African researchers, either Ph.D. students in their final year prior to degree completion or those who completed their Ph.D. no earlier than 2016. Priority is given to researchers who are African nationals based and working in – or soon returning to – Africa, with proposals relating to the research themes indicated above. Qualified female researchers are particularly encouraged to apply. STAARS welcomes applications from fresh Ph.D. graduates who can benefit from mentorship and additional training to become internationally respected and recognized researchers. Fellows are expected to complete the proposed project by submitting findings as a complete working paper by December 15, 2021 and proceeding to submit the paper to a peer-reviewed journal and conferences in early 2022.
          <br><br>
          Researchers are expected to be familiar with existing data sets and have a strong working knowledge of appropriate software, typically Stata and/or R, and an interest in econometric analysis of high-quality data sets. Knowledge of Stata and/or R will be assessed at the finalist stage.
        </p>
        <h2>Funding</h2>
        <p>
          The selected applicants will receive funds to cover travel and participation in a three-week mentorship program at Cornell University. Due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel may not be possible in 2021. The 2021 program will begin online and we will evaluate the feasibility of travel in mid-2021.
          <br><br>
          The proposed research and capacity development activities are expected to be undertaken as part of an ongoing effort by the scholar.  No salary support is available;  STAARS will not cover the scholar’s time allocated to this research. A letter of support from the candidate’s supervisor is required.
