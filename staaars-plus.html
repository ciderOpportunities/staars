      <h2><b>Background</b></h2>
      <p>The STAAARS+ Fellows program, a part of the <a href = "https://www.canr.msu.edu/prci/">USAID Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Food Security
        Policy Research, Capacity, and Influence (PRCI)</a>, is a collaboration between Cornell University, Michigan
        State University (MSU), and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) to advance rigorous,
        policy-oriented food security research on topics of inclusive agricultural- and rural transformation,
        development of healthy food systems, and enhanced resilience at individual, household, national and
        regional levels in Africa and Asia. The objective is to build and reinforce an effective policy research
        culture within African and Asian policy research organizations that can help build and sustain research
        capacity beyond the life of PRCI and the STAAARS+ program. </p>


      <p>STAAARS+ teams of two to three individuals are selected through a competitive process and paired with
        mentors at <a href ="../staars/materials/Cornell_Bios_08182022.pdf">Cornell</a>, <a href ="../staars/materials/IFPRI_Bios_08182022.pdf">IFPRI</a> or <a href ="../staars/materials/MSU_Bios_08182022.pdf">MSU</a>, with whom they will work collaboratively on a research topic of
        mutual interest that fits within PRCI's broad research priorities. STAAARS+ will support the development
        of research findings publishable in high quality, peer-reviewed journals; facilitate access to policy
        outreach networks and policy engagement materials; provide professional development training; build
        Fellows' international research networks; and support teams’ participation in scientific and policy
        conferences. The first cohort of STAAARS+ teams was selected in 2020. This RFP marks the beginning of
        selection for the fourth and final cohort of teams.</p>
      <p>The STAAARS+ and the Structural Transformation of African Agriculture and Rural Spaces (STAARS)
        programs have led to peer-reviewed publications in journals such as World Development, American
        Journal of Agricultural Economics, and Journal of Development Economics. Results from a recent study of
        past fellows showed a slight increase in publication rates of fellows as compared to non-selected
        applicants. A more thorough description of the program and outcomes found in the study can be found
        <a href ="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aepp.13310">here.</a> </p>

        <p>A <b>summary of our Cohort 2 fellows’ work</b> and their <b>final presentation session</b> can be found <a href = "https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/staaars-plus-second-cohort-wraps-up-fellowships">here</a>.</p>

      <h2><b>Scope of Research and Geographic Focus</b></h2>

      <p>Prospective STAAARS+ teams are invited to develop proposals in the following thematic areas. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Inclusive agricultural and rural transformation to raise rural household incomes (including but not limited to small farmers), and to create more decent jobs, particularly for women and youth; </li>
        <li>Development of healthy food systems, including regulatory issues and private sector engagement, in ways that address food safety and the triple burden of malnutrition; and</li>
        <li>Enhanced resilience at individual, household, national and regional levels (to climate, conflict, and other sources of shocks) to achieve economic and environmental sustainability.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>STAAARS+ teams’ rigorous policy analysis should use existing, high quality data, such as the <a href = "http://surveys.worldbank.org/lsms/programs/integrated-surveys-agriculture-ISA">Living Standards Measurement Study - Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA)</a>, <a href = "https://dhsprogram.com/">Demographic and Health Surveys</a>, or similar datasets. 
        High quality data sets collected locally, by an applicant’s institution or other
        research organizations in Africa or Asia, can be proposed and will be considered based on a case-by-case
        assessment of data quality. Mixed methods research projects are welcome. No funding is available for
        new data collection nor software purchase. Teams are welcome to approach researchers within the <a href ="https://www.canr.msu.edu/prci/">PRCI</a>
        network for guidance on the suitability of a topic and research design for STAAARS+ support. </p>
      <h2><b>Program Structure</b></h2>
      <p>The STAAARS+ program spans 18 months from the release of the RFP to the delivery of final outputs by
        the STAAARS+ teams. Selected STAAARS+ teams are matched with one (or two) faculty or senior
        research staff mentor(s) who share an interest in the proposed topic and is willing to be available
        extensively for consultation and collaboration throughout the duration of the fellowship period.
        Mentorship and collaboration begin immediately with a series of launch workshops involving the
        fellows, mentors and STAAARS+ leadership occurring during the first six weeks of the fellowship period.
        A period of regular remote collaboration follows, with weekly or biweekly virtual meetings. During this
        period, training workshops are held at relevant points in the teams’ research process. Training
        workshops are designed to assist in fellows’ professional development and supplement their technical
        skills. Topics may include but are not limited to: coding and data management skills; reproducible
        research processes; technical writing; presentation skills; time management; grant writing; navigating
        peer review; research ethics; and policy engagement planning. Approximately 9 months from the
        release of the RFP, the STAAARS+ teams spend three weeks visiting a US-based host institution (Cornell,
        MSU or IFPRI) at which the STAAARS+ team works intensively on the research project while participating
        in network-building and capacity development activities customized to their self-identified specific
        needs as a team. STAAARS+ teams will also engage with the broader community through presentations
        of their work, either in-person (travel restrictions pending) or virtually, at the annual ReNAPRI policy
        conference or other events organized by PRCI. </p>

      <h2><b>Eligibility</b></h2>
      <p>This call is open for teams of two to three early career African or Asian researchers currently working for
        eligible policy research institutions based in sub-Saharan Africa or Asia. Team members must be actively
        engaged in research, as manifest in published work within the past four years, and hold an M.S. or Ph.D.,
        or equivalent degree – with a strong preference for teams containing multiple Ph.D.-holders – in
        agricultural economics, economics, geography, sociology, statistics, or a related field. Team members
        with PhDs should have completed their PhD no more than five years prior to the application deadline,
        although in exceptional cases a team of three could include one member whose PhD was awarded no
        more than ten years prior. Priority is given to proposals from PRCI-affiliated institutions2
        , but teams from other research institutions based in sub-Saharan Africa or low- and middle-income countries of
        South Asia and Southeast Asia will be considered. Teams from government-affiliated universities or
        research institutions in Myanmar or Cambodia are ineligible, per USAID restrictions. Qualified female
        researchers are particularly encouraged to apply and topics with an explicit gender dimension are of
        particular interest. For guidance, we recommend reviewing <a href ="https://www.canr.msu.edu/prci/Capacity-Strengthening/Technical-Training/Core-Center-Training/Module%201%20Integrating%20gender%20in%20policy%20research%20and%20outreach">training materials on integrating gender into
        policy research and outreach. </a></p>

      <p>The institutions of successful applicants are required to support STAAARS+ team members in their
        STAAARS+ work. Sending institutions must provide all STAAARS+ team members with adequate funded
        time to carry out their research during the remote program periods as well as during travel periods to
        conferences, workshops, and the mentor’s institution in the United States (US). This should be
        documented in a letter of support for each team member (see Application Process for more details).</p>

      <p>All travel is contingent on safety with respect to public health risks at the time of travel. Team members
        must be fully released from other obligations for travel during a three-week intensive collaboration visit
        to Cornell, IFPRI, or MSU (depending on their mentor’s institution). Teams will also participate in a
        roughly weeklong policy conference hosted by <a href ="http://www.renapri.org/">ReNAPRI</a> during or shortly after the fellowship period.
        Support of travel to attend the conference in-person will be handled on a case-by-case basis. STAAARS+
        through PRCI will provide financial support to cover travel expenses for two team members to attend
        the three weeks visit to Cornell, IFPRI or MSU. Covered expenses will include visa application, airfare,
        per diems and accommodation at the U.S. institution. Teams’ institutions must facilitate the visa
        application and any other local actions that need to be taken to make the travel possible. </p>
      
      
        <h2><b>Application Process</b></h2>
      <p>STAAARS+ leadership held an information webinar on <b>Wednesday, September 14th</b>. 
        A recording of the session can be found <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5iAiX_E0Ho">here</a>. 
        A copy of the slides from the session, including links to referenced content, can be found <a href = "Info Session presentation_STAAARSPlus_09132022.pdf">here</a>.</p>
      
      <p>The STAAARS+ fellowship application process is managed by Cornell University. A team of two or three
        researchers from one or more eligible policy research institution(s) submits one application. Applicants
        must prepare a concept proposal (maximum 2500 words), which motivates the selected research issue(s) and objectives, outlines data sources and proposed analytical methodology. The team must
        document it has access to the data proposed for analysis and is free to produce publishable research
        using those data. The proposal must also contain a feasible and detailed division of labor, explicitly
        outlining the roles and responsibilities of each team member and a timeline for completing a rigorous
        paper ready for submission to a peer-reviewed international journal, as well as policy engagement
        materials based on the research, within the 18-month fellowship period. All proposals must be
        submitted in English. All proposals will be peer reviewed by experts from Cornell, MSU and/or IFPRI.
        Finalists will be expected to demonstrate adequate competence within the team in statistical analysis
        software (Stata or R) prior to final selection, established via a structured assessment. </p>

      <p>The deadline to submit a concept proposal is <b>October 16, 2022 at 11:59 PM New York time</b>. Applicants
