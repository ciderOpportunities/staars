                <p>Tesfahun A. Kasie is an assistant professor in the Institute of Disaster Risk Management & Food
                    Security Studies at Bahir Dar University (Ethiopia). His main research interests include disaster
                    risk, livelihood resilience and food security. He received his doctoral degree in Local Development
                    & International Cooperation from Jaume I University (Spain) in 2017. His Ph.D. thesis examined
                    resilience properties of rural livelihoods constructed in the risky environments of Ethiopia. In his
                    thesis he makes use of interdisciplinary perspectives involving Modern Portfolio Theory, Household
                    Economy and Social-ecological systems Approaches to explain resilience properties of household
                    livelihood systems with food security as the primary wellbeing outcomes of concern. Following his
                    Ph.D. study he continued investigating the same research agenda on risk and resilience as applied to
                    social systems covering wider range of wellbeing outcomes including health and nutrition security.
