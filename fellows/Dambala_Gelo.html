                <p>Dambala Gelo works as a Postdoc Fellow in the School of Economics, University of Cape Town, South Africa. He is a Research Associate at Public and Environmental Economics Research Centre(PEERC), University of Johannesburg and Research Fellow in the Department of Economics, University of Mannheim. Dambala is an applied microeconomist and applied econometrician, who focuses on development, environmental and public economics issues. Much of his research involves applications of natural experiment and field experiments for identification of causal effects in commons management, energy, education, household’s saving and agricultural contracts. His other empirical researches has focused on non-market valuation where he applied discrete choice modelling to estimate the benefits of environmental and other public goods in monetary terms. In behavioural economics, his research interest involves behavioral decision theory and behavioral game theory. Here, he is primarily interested in individual preferences and learning under uncertainty, strategic reasoning, and group interaction in situations involving coordination, cooperation, and conflict. Applications of interest are technology adoption and investment under uncertainty, bargaining, incomplete contracts, competition, commons appropriation and public goods contribution.
                <br><br>
                Dambala received his PhD in Economics from University of Pretoria and MSc in Economics from Norwegian University of life Sciences.
