                <p>Amy Faye is a citizen of Senegal and holds a Bachelor degree in Mathematics and Economics from the University Toulouse 1 Capitole and a Master’s degree in industrial organization from the Toulouse School of Economics. Following her studies, Amy started working at the Senegalese Institute of Agricultural Research (ISRA), beginning with an internship. She took an interest in agricultural economics which motivated her to join the macro-economic analysis unit (BAME) within ISRA as a research assistant in 2012 when she also registered as a doctoral student at the Faculty of Economics of the University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar. She is now a full-time researcher in the same unit. Her Ph.D. research focused on modeling climate change impacts on irrigation water availability and analyzing taxation policy to manage groundwater resources in the northern coastal area of Senegal called Niayes. She completed her dissertation in early 2018. During her Ph.D. she has worked in collaboration with researchers from the University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, IFPRI and LUKE (Finland). Amy has also worked on many other topics among which agricultural susatainability at farm level, value chains analysis, collective action and its impact on farms revenus and other topics related to peasant economics. </p>
