                <p>Larissa is a Researcher at the University of Dschang and has just completed a Ph.D. in Applied Economy
Policy and Analysis. Her PhD dissertation concerns three essays on the political economic of African
Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs). She examined SWFs emergence and proliferation in a context of
extreme poverty , boom of population growth rate, urgent development needs with specific focus : on
SWFs as tools for political survival , SWFs as tool of institutional reform for a better governance and
management of resource revenues and SWFs as a tool to address infrastructure finance gap in fragile
and conflicts affected States through co-investments between Multi-Development Banks (MDB),
foreign most performant SWFs and African SWFs host countries. These type of Co-investments can
help to mitigate political risks in fragile contexts and help reconstruction and peacebuilding process in
post-conflicts regions.
<br><br>
Her scholarly interest’s lies at the intersection of: Applied macro-economy, development economics,
Applied Econometric, Survival Models, Economy of Fragile and Conflicts Affected States. Recently,
she is also interested in researching on poverty dynamics , Gender Studies, Climate Adaptation Studies,
Impact Evaluation methods, Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling and micro- applied
economy. She has been involved in research collaborations with the World Bank, UNU-WIDER and
currently with Cornell University under STAARS program.</p>
