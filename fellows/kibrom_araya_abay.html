Before moving to Denmark for his graduate studies, Kibrom worked as graduate assistant at Mekele University (Ethiopia) (2006-2008).</p> <p>
    Kibrom’s research interest lies at the intersection of applied microeconometrics, behavioral economics and development economics. In doing his Ph.D. and Postdoctoral projects, he has conducted research broadly involving applied microeconometrics and policy evaluation methods in various economic problems, mainly behavioral and development economics. He possesses strong quantitative and microeconometric skills that can be applied to wide spectrum of economic problems. He also an expert on discrete choice modelling and has published some papers on empirical and methodological aspects related to choice modeling. </p><p>
    Recently, he is more interested in researching on the psychological and behavioral implications of poverty. In some of his recent work, he is investigating the implication of psychological capital and personality traits on intertemporal decision making behavior, including saving behavior, considering rural households in Ethiopia. In another project, he is exploring behavioral and psychological explanations to reconcile the existing low levels adoption of seemingly profitable agricultural technologies in Sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere.
