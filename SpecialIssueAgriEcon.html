                <h3 class="staars">Background</h3>

                <p>A disproportionately large share of the poor in Sub-Saharan Africa, and especially of the ultra-poor, live in rural areas, rely on agriculture, self-employment, and casual wage labor markets in the informal sector as their primary source of earnings, and rely on food markets as their primary source of consumption goods. Despite the overall macroeconomic growth and improved governance enjoyed broadly across the continent, farms remain small, many African smallholder farmers still use few modern inputs, and widespread market failures impede optimal allocation of labor, land and other factors of production.</p>

                <img class="rad" src="images/photos/bean.jpg" width="200px" style="float:left; margin-top:5px;margin-right:10px;">
                <p>Structural transformation requires, in particular, productivity growth, which itself depends on increased uptake of improved technologies and inputs that improve the productivity of land and especially labor. It also requires progress in remedying labor, land and financial market failures that impede not only technology adoption, but also efficient resource allocation and investment. It further requires improved efficiency and value addition in connecting farmers to markets, as well as enhanced resilience in the face of growing risks due to climate, market and political shocks.</p>

                <p>Most of the extant analysis of structural transformation relies on macro-level data sources and economywide modeling, but newly available household- and individual-level data sources, such as the Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) expand the potential to understand constraints facing African farmers and behaviors underlying the macro-level trends. Leveraging the opportunities provided by such data will provide powerful guidance to policymakers who aim to accelerate the pace of agricultural transformation.

                <h3 class="staars">Special Issue</h3>
                <p>The special issue is forthcoming.  Please check back for a link.</p>
                <!--<p><i>Agricultural Economics</i> invites the submission of papers to be considered in a special issue to be organized in coordination with the Structural Transformation of African Agriculture and Rural Spaces (STAARS) initiative, a partnership between the African Development Bank (AfDB), Cornell University, the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC), the Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP), and the World Bank. The STAARS partners plan the special issue to build on a conference on Structural Transformation of African Agriculture and Rural Spaces, to be held on <b>December 4-5, 2015 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia</b>.  In addition to the research featured at the STAARS conference, the editorial committee seeks high quality papers on related topics that might also be included in the special issue.</p>

                <p>The organizers invite submissions from all areas of work related to the micro-foundations of structural transformation in Sub-Saharan Africa, including but not limited to: agricultural productivity and innovation, technology adoption, labor productivity, youth and women in agriculture, factor market performance, non-farm diversification and labor re-allocation, human capital investment and dynamics, financing and risk management, market access, and related fields of policy-relevant inquiry. A common denominator will be empirical analysis based on high quality, publicly available panel data sets from sub-Saharan Africa. Papers authored by African scholars are particularly encouraged.</p>

                <p>All submissions, including those submitted to the STAARS conference and those submitted independently, will be peer-reviewed through a process coordinated by the guest editors.</p>

                <p>Published papers will be expected to follow the formatting standards of Agricultural Economics at the time of publication.  Formatting instructions, including length requirements, can be found online <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1574-0862/homepage/ForAuthors.html">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>Submission Instructions</h3>
                <p>Full draft papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format by March 1, 2016, without indication of authorship, following the instructions provided online at: <a href="https://editorialexpress.com/agecon">https://editorialexpress.com/agecon</a> . Be sure to indicate that this is a submission for the STAARS special issue. Acceptance decisions will be communicated by May 15, 2016. For more information, contact Dr. Paul Christian at <a href="mailto:staars@cornell.edu">staars@cornell.edu</a>.-->
